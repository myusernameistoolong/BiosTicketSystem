# ðŸŽ¬ Cinema Ticket System â€“ C# Design Patterns Showcase

This C# console application simulates a cinema ticketing system â€” but its true purpose is to serve as a playground for **intensive use of design patterns**. Created to demonstrate proficiency in software architecture and pattern implementation, this project intentionally applies a wide range of patterns far beyond typical necessity.

This project was intentionally **over-engineered** to explore and demonstrate mastery of object-oriented design principles and patterns. It is not intended for production use or realistic application.

> This project was developed as part of a school assignment for an **Solution Architecture** course.
